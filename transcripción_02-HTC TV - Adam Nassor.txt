[00:00:00 --> 00:00:12] Hi, it's T.C. Family. It's Adam from season 9 and this is the story of a hypnotist turned
[00:00:12 --> 00:00:20] high to get closer. Let's begin the story in March 2019 before I joined it. I was at
[00:00:20 --> 00:00:26] a point in time where many people would kill for to be. I was a hypnotist earning 10k a month
[00:00:26 --> 00:00:31] already and I was the only hypnotist in Australia still I have that earns the kind of money with
[00:00:31 --> 00:00:40] this. So why? Why change? Why do that? Well, even though I earned that much money, I basically
[00:00:40 --> 00:00:45] had no money left every month. In addition to that, once I had no clients in the weekends
[00:00:45 --> 00:00:51] because I was able to get them free, I was acting self-destructive. I was wasting my time
[00:00:51 --> 00:00:58] in front of gaming console playing games and not doing anything with my life. I took
[00:00:58 --> 00:01:05] me so much work and so much sacrifice just to get myself to a self-employed state that
[00:01:05 --> 00:01:14] I was living like an employee and I felt so stuck. Hypnosis gave me purpose, I changed my
[00:01:14 --> 00:01:20] life around, I changed many lives and I thought it was the one thing that gives my life
[00:01:20 --> 00:01:29] a meaning. I still felt meaningless and it was horrible. One day my fiance read me a book
[00:01:29 --> 00:01:36] and in a book there was one sentence that said, you're watching your own private TV station
[00:01:36 --> 00:01:42] and some people watch a bad program and instead of changing it, they bitch about it. And
[00:01:42 --> 00:01:48] so I was thinking, what am I feeding myself? What am I doing? And in fact, I was feeding
[00:01:48 --> 00:01:56] myself a lot of BS. So I changed it. I started to watch motivational videos. Until one day,
[00:01:56 --> 00:02:03] our seafood pops up in my feed. After a few more videos, I found there was profound value
[00:02:03 --> 00:02:08] in everything he said. And so I felt that he's very real and I followed him on Instagram,
[00:02:08 --> 00:02:15] found the webinar and then James Lane closed me on HTC. Now what did happen since then?
[00:02:15 --> 00:02:20] Week three, first food for my business, I tremendously increased my prices so I need
[00:02:20 --> 00:02:25] to work way less. Next thing that happened within a very short amount of time, I have a
[00:02:25 --> 00:02:32] lot of influencers, many of them are very qualified by the God them at least. And now, today,
[00:02:32 --> 00:02:40] I have closed over $150,000 US dollars. This is basically only six months, half a year.
[00:02:40 --> 00:02:45] The third of which was for my own business and the rest was for the influencers I worked
[00:02:45 --> 00:02:55] with. But still, the money was evaporating and then came CIV. Seafood showed me that I was
[00:02:55 --> 00:03:01] believing a lie. He showed me that I was thinking that I need urgency to act and that it is
[00:03:01 --> 00:03:06] struggle to be successful. And so unconsciously, I was blowing my money away. I was some of
[00:03:06 --> 00:03:11] it, I was the rain last thing, but still I was blowing it away and it was broke all the
[00:03:11 --> 00:03:18] time. Now, I understand what it means to not be like that. Also, I realized another lie
[00:03:18 --> 00:03:23] that I could finally dissolve. I thought when I learned I take it closing, that I have
[00:03:23 --> 00:03:30] to give up hypnosis and that I would give up being a hypnotist and stop being who I am.
[00:03:30 --> 00:03:34] And I was terrified of that. It was one of my greatest fears that I have to give up
[00:03:34 --> 00:03:39] hypnosis and stop being who I am, but now I understood. Hypnosis is one tool for change.
[00:03:39 --> 00:03:44] Closing is another and I don't have to decide between that to confuse them, become a master
[00:03:44 --> 00:03:51] of both worlds and provide double the value. For these realizations, I am eternally grateful
[00:03:51 --> 00:03:57] to you, CIV. And I am eternally grateful to this wonderful family, to your desk man, to your
[00:03:57 --> 00:04:04] Tina, to the accountability group leaders, especially you, Anis, by helping me out so much.
[00:04:04 --> 00:04:14] And now, proudly, I say, my name is Adam Nasir and I am a high ticket closer. No matter how far
[00:04:14 --> 00:04:19] you think you are from your goals, no matter how distant you feel from yourself. Don't believe
[00:04:19 --> 00:04:29] this lie because you are closer than you think.
